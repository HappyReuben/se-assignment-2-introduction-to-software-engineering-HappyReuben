Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is a discipline that applies engineering principles and methods to develop and maintain high quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering differs from traditional programming in that, the latter focuses merely on formulating a set of codes for the purpose of solving one particular problem, while the former represents a bigger picture where certain principles are followed such as planning, designing and maintaining a project.
Example of traditional programming is developing set of codes to analyse or calculate large set of data.
Example of Software engineering is the development of Windows OS, and MacOS.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
SDLC is a process adopted by software engineers to design, develop, test, and develop high quality softwares. Phases involved in SDLC include Planning/requirement, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.
Planning and/or requirement phase, involves determing a problem to be solved, or a project concept and its scope. A this stage, all the gaps that needs to be addressed by the end of the project should be noted down.
Design - The stage where a roadmap and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface are outlined.
Implementation - writing codes following the designed software architecture
Testing - conducting tests to ensure the software meets the set quality, standards, and functional requirements.
Deployment - Make the software availale for use
Maintenance - At this stage, technical support is provided to problem arising after deployment. With this, the software is continually being improved.
Evaluation may also be carried out at this stage, to benchmark against the set objectives, and also identify areas of improvement for the next project.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Considering the two major methodologies for software development: both Waterfall and Agile methodologies share a common goal of creating high quality softwares.
Both of these methods will require a software developer to plan ahead and have structure on how the project will be implemented especially that they both provide room for collaboration with other developers to create the best software.
However, these two differ in their approaches such that:
Waterfall models - is a methdology that will require the developer to follow a predetimined step by step guideline to develop a software such as requirements, designing, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
whereas,
Agile models is an iterative and incremental approach that gives flexibility, collaboration, and adaptability. The
Waterfall models will be preferred when developing a short-term project, while Agile model is suitable for a longterm project.
Waterfall models may also be suitable when working on projects that are likely to change in the process, like working on regultory-driven projects; while Agile models will be suitable for projects that may involve chaanging with time such as creativity/innovation, or requiring customer feedback during the process of creation.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirement engineering is crucial stage in SDLC where a developer needs to understand and document what his/her final product/software should do/address.
Here, the develop will:
interact with users to determine their needs,
categorise what is important and what is possible,
jolt down the requirements and state exactly what needs to be done during coding process
Making sure what is written, matches what the users want
Managing changes by keeping track of any changes based on user needs, as the project goes along


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design is the process of dividing a project into smaller manageable projects that can be developed, tested and mantained separetely, but also interact with each other through a well-defined interface.
Modularity - creating smaller modules improves maintainability by having smaller and easily understood projects which allows for simpler testing, isolation to change without impacting other modules, and also parrallel development - separate teams developing bigger project at the same time.
Modularity improves scalability by providing possibility to reuse small modules into other projects, separate deployment that may allow for independent updates, and also enhancing adaptability of the software to changes as per requirements
Example when developing a healthcare software, smal modules may be created such as User Management module, Service catalogue modules, Consultation modules, Inventory modules, and Notification module.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Software testing involves several levels to ensure software works as per intended objectives. Main of levels of software testing are:
 Unit testing - testing individual pieces of codes yo ensure they work correctly
 Integration testing - testing integration between different modules e.g. checking whether user modules interact with notification modules. 
 System testing - testing the entire software to ensure it meets the oultlined requirements
 Acceptance testing - testing the software against user requirement to ensure it meets user needs.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems VCS are software tools for tracking changes to software code and coordinating work among members. example of popular VCS is Git and Subversion.
Importance of VCS
 multiple devlopers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwritting each others work.
 keeps a history of all changes made to the software
 allow developers to revert to previous versions of the code if something goes wrong
 devolopers can work on separate features separately and then merge them back together
 acts as a backup sytem by keeping copies of previous project versions.
 facilitates code review processes where changes can be reviewed before being integrated back into the software.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
A software project manager plays a crucial role of guiding/supervising a software project from inception to completion.
Key responsibilities of the manager include planning, communicating, resource management and managing implementation to ensure timely delivery of a project.
When managing a software project, one may face challenges such as project deadlines, continually changing user requirements, budget constraints, the need to meet quality expectation, and also ensuring team members have necessary technical knowledge.  


Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is the process of mantaining and updating software after its initial release to ensure correct and efficient functioning over time.
Types of Maintenance activities are:
 Corrective Maintenance to fix a problem or software bug
 Adaptive Maintenance - updating software to meet new changes/reuirements
 Perfective Maintenance - making the software better by adding new features and improve performance
 Preventive Maintenance - making changes to prevent potential issues before they occur.
Software Maintenance is essential to SDLC since it ensures longevity and usability of the software; Error correction (bug fix); adaptation to change; and performance improvement.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical issues faced by Software engineers include
 Security threats such as hacking;
 Privacy concerns because of managing user's sensitive information,
 Intellectual property eg violating software licence when using third-party code.
 Transparency - failing to inform users about data collection practices and how the data is used,
 Quality and reliability, misuse of software eg creating surveillance systems for security but instead being used for harmful purposes,
 Algorithmic biases - creating algorithms that favours certain demographic.
Software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work by:
 Following professional code of ethics,
 Prioritise user privacy and security
 Respect intellectual propoerty.
 Ensure transparency
 Correct algorithmic bias
 Commit to quality and reliability.
